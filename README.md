# payment

The idea is to have an independent service for anybody looking to build a Payment module in their project. The service will be plug and play, adapting the repository pattern so you can have any database of your choice.

Payments are one of the most delicate part of any project and hence I am trying to learn the best practices from all across the resources from Uber Engineering, Stripe, Razorpay and building all of such stuff in mind.
